Run /python/TableData.py

The tables in the text file are identified based on the minimum table size as specified by the user 

The code lists creates a new TableData instance for each text file in the /data folder.

All the format processing is done by the TableData class, which is carried(process_file) out as soon as the constructor is called.

To get the Data Frame version, get_dataframe() is called once the TableData instance is created, which returns the dataframe version of the processed table data.

*Bugs*
See UBS15, "Balance in statement..." line is included as part of previous table row content. May need to do manual filtering
